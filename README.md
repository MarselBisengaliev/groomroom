## About this project:
<p>While working on this project, I implemented authorization using Laravel's built-in class, Auth. I also distributed the roles by creating a role table, displaying the posts, and giving the administrator the right to change their status.</p>
<p>I also learned how to create a SetTimeout function. It is used to constantly call another function. In this project it was necessary: to make sure that the time was correctly updated.</p>
